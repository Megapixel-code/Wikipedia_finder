# Wikipedia_finder
A program that will give you the quickest path from a wikepedia page to another

Wikepedia is a very large website so the program is kinda slow, if you have any ideas to improve it tell me!


You need to give the starting url in the starting_page variable

Same for the end url with the ending_page variable
